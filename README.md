Project for the course MALCOM (Machine Learning for Communication).

- Resume of the TadGAN work (see the paper TadGAN - Time series Anomaly Detection using GANs

- Retaking of their code in the ipynb file called "TadGAN - Time series Anomaly Detection using GANs".

- "How to Implement Wasserstein Loss for Generative Adversarial Networks" doc to understand what is Wasserstein loss and how to use it.
